My name is David Bertoin, I am a research engineer at [IRT Saint-Exupery](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com/fr/) where I am part of the [DEEL](https://www.deel.ai/) and [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/) research programs.
In parallel, I am in my last year of PhD at [ISAE SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/) in the [SuReLI](https://sureli.isae-supaero.fr/) team under the supervision of [Emmanuel Rachelson](http://emmanuel.rachelson.free.fr/) and [SÃ©bastien Gerchinovitz](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~sgerchin/).   
Finally I am also a part-time associate professor at [INSA Toulouse](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/fr/index.html).
My research is mainly focused on state representations in Reinforcement learning in order to improve generalization.
