Hi, my name is David Bertoin, I am a research engineer at [Photoroom](https://www.photoroom.com/) where I mostly work on training diffusion models for image editing.  
I am also a part-time associate professor at [INSA Toulouse](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/fr/index.html).  
My research is mainly focused on representation learning in general with a particular focus on computer vision and reinforcement learning. 
Before that I was a research scientist at [IRT Saint-Exupery](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com/fr/) where I was part of the [DEEL](https://www.deel.ai/) and [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/) research programs.
