The European Workshop on Reinforcement Learning is the gathering hub of the RL research community in Europe and one of the main world-class events in RL. We plan to make the 2024 edition an exciting event for researchers worldwide, both for the presentation of top quality papers, but also as a forum for ample discussion of open problems and future research directions.
